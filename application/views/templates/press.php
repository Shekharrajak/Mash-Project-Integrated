                                <P>The 1st YouthMobile Experts Meeting was held at UNESCO HQ on 19-20 March 2014. <br>
UNESCO has conducted a global search for the best, existing mobile applications training initiatives with openly-licensed training materials, and invited a selected group of training providers and app development tools makers.<br>

MASH Project has been the only organisation to be selected from India and among 16 organisations selected from all over the world.<br>

UNESCO seeks to extensively promote very high-quality, multi-lingual, comprehensive training materials for developing mobile apps. Openly-licensed, the training materials identified will allow for adaptations including translation, localization, and innovations. The YouthMobile experts meeting is part of UNESCOâ€™s contribution to the 2014 celebrations for Open Education Week. </P>
